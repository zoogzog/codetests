Oh, baby, baby

Oh, baby, baby,
How was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here?
Oh, baby, baby,
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah

Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby,
'Cause I need to know now, oh, because...

My loneliness
Is killing me and I
I must confess
I still believe, still believe
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

Oh, baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Boy, you got me blinded
Oh, pretty baby,
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it

Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby,
'Cause I need to know now, oh, because...

My loneliness
Is killing me and I
I must confess
I still believe, still believe
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
Ah, yeah, yeah

Oh, baby, baby,
How was I supposed to know?
Oh, pretty baby,
I shouldn't have let you go

I must confess
That my loneliness
Is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here
And give me a sign?
Hit me, baby, one more time

My loneliness
Is killing me and I
I must confess
I still believe, still believe
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

I must confess
That my loneliness
Is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here
And give me a sign?
Hit me, baby, one more time

"(You Drive Me) Crazy"

Baby, I'm so into you
You got that somethin'. What can I do?
Baby, you spin me around
The earth is movin' but I can't feel the ground

Every time you look at me
My heart is jumpin', it's easy to see

Lovin' you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before

[Chorus:]
You drive me crazy
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Oh... crazy,
But it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night

Tell me, you're so into me
That I'm the only one you will see
Tell me, I'm not in the blue,
That I'm not wastin' my feelings on you

Lovin' you means so much more.
More than anything I ever felt before

[Chorus]

Crazy,

Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night

"Sometimes"

You tell me you're in love with me
Like you can't take your pretty eyes away from me
It's not that I don't want to stay
But every time you come too close I move away

I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me move slow
There's things about me you just have to know

Sometimes I run
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right, be with you day and night
Baby, all I need is time

I don't wanna be so shy
Every time that I'm alone I wonder why
Hope that you will wait for me
You'll see that you're the only one for me

I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me move slow
There's things about me you just have to know

Sometimes I run (sometimes)
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right, be with you day and night
All I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right, be with you day and night
Baby all I need is time

Just hang around and you'll see
There's nowhere I'd rather be
If you love me, trust in me
The way that I trust in you

Sometimes I run (sometimes)
Sometimes I hide,
Sometimes I'm scared of you (oh)
But all I really want is to hold you tight (hold you tight)
Treat you right, be with you day and night (day and night)

Sometimes I run (sometimes)
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right, be with you day and night (day and night)

All I really want is to hold you tight
Be with you day and night

Sometimes I run (sometimes)
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight

"Born To Make You Happy"

[Intro:]
Oh, my love [laugh]
Oh, yeah yeah
Oh, yeah 

[Verse 1:]
I'm sitting here alone up in my room
I'm thinking about the times that we've been through 
Oh, my love
I'm looking at a picture in my hand
Trying my best to understand
I really want to know what we did wrong 
With a love that felt so strong
If only you were here tonight 
I know that we could make it right 

[Chorus:]
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only one up in my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever, you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy

[Verse 2:]
I know I've been a fool since you've been gone
I'd better give it up and carry on 
Oh, my love
'Cause living in a dream of you and me 
Is not the way my life should be
I don't want to cry a tear for you 
So forgive me if I do (ooh)
If only you were here tonight 
I know that we could make it right

[Chorus:]
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only one up in my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever, you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy

[Hook:]
(Oh yeah)
(Oh yeah)
I'd do anything 
I'd give you my world
I'd wait forever to be your girl
(Just call out my name)
Just call out my name (and I will be there) and I will be there (ooh)
Just to show you how much I care (alright) (ooh)
I was born to make you happy, yeah (ooh) (oh yeah)

[Chorus:] 
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only one up in my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever, you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
(Oh, oh)
I was born to make you happy 
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
Always and forever, you and me
That's the way our life should be

"From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart"

"Never look back," we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so?
Loneliness up ahead, emptiness behind
Where do I go?

And you didn't hear
All my joy through my tears
All my hopes through my fears
Did you know, still I miss you somehow

[CHORUS:]
From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love, you were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love, I never knew love
'Til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart

"Baby," I said, "please stay.
Give our love a chance for one more day"
We could have worked things out
Taking time is what love's all about

But you put a dart
Through my dreams through my heart
And I'm back where I started again
Never thought it would end

[Repeat CHORUS]

You promised yourself
But to somebody else
And you made it so perfectly clear
Still I wish you were here

[Repeat CHORUS]

"Never look back," we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so?

"I Will Be There"

Oh yeah

You don't have to say what's on your mind
'Cause I know where you've been
Give it up and leave it all behind
And then let me begin

Come on over here
Let me show how things should be
I will make it alright
Let me make it clear
You can put your trust in me
Yes I will be there

[CHORUS:]
When you need someone
You just turn around
And I, will be there
When you're feeling low
Baby let me know
And I, will be there

Won't you let me make it up to you
Now you know where I am
There ain't nothin that I wouldn't do
Just to love once again

Come on over here
Let me show how things should be
I will make it alright
Let me make it clear
You can put your trust in me
Yes I will be there

[Repeat CHORUS]

I will be there
Just take a stand
I'll be here for you
Now and forever
Give one more chance
To show you how much I care
I'll be there

When you need someone
I just turn around
And I will be there
When you're in sorrow
Just let me know and I will be there

When the suns start burning

"Deep in My Heart"

Walking through time looking for an answer
How can it be this way
What have I done
I just can't help but wonder
How everything could change.

[Chorus-1:]
'Cause you've turned my world around
Since you came along, no
After this love was found it seems like we can't go wrong.

I know there's only you
And right from the start I always knew

Oops!... I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Oh, baby, baby
Oops!... You think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

You see my problem is this
I'm dreaming away
Wishing that heroes—they truly exist
I cry watching the days
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways

But to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Baby, oh

Don't go knockin' on my door
Gotta stay away for sure
And now I ain't buyin' that
You better get off my back

"Satisfaction"

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
And I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no satisfaction 

When I'm drivin' in my car
And that man comes on the radio
And he's tellin' me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination
I can't get no, oh no no no
Hey hey hey, this what I say

[CHORUS:]
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no reaction
And I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no satisfaction

When I'm watchin' my TV
and that girl comes on to tell me
how tight my skirts should be
well she can't tell me who to be
cause I've got my own identity.
I can't get no, oh no no no

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction

[Repeat CHORUS]

I can't get no, satisfaction
I can't get no, satisfaction

I can't get no satisfaction baby
"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know"

My friends say you're so into me
And that you need me desperately
They say you say we're so complete 

But I need to hear it straight from you
If you want me to believe it's true
I've been waiting for so long it hurts
I wanna hear you say the words, please

[CHORUS:]
Don't, don't let me be the last to know
Don't hold back, just let it go
I need to hear you say
You need me all the way
Oh, if you love me so
Don't let me be the last to know

Your body language says so much
Yeah, I feel it in the way you touch
But til' you say the words it's not enough
C'mon and tell me you're in love, please

[Repeat CHORUS]

C'mon baby, c'mon darling, ooh yeah
C'mon, let me be the one
C'mon now, oh yeah

I need to hear you say
You love me all the way
And I don't wanna wait another day
I wanna feel the way you feel
Oh, c'mon

Don't, just let me be the one
Don't hold back, just let it go
I need to hear you say
You need me all the way
So…baby, if you love me
Don't let me be the last to know

"What U See (Is What You Get)"

You used to say that I was special
Everything was right
But now you think I'm wearing too much make-up
That my dress is too tight
You got no reasons to be jealous
I've never been untrue
So does it really matter if they're looking
I'm only looking at you
You should never try to change me
I can be nobody else
And I like the way I am 

[Chorus:]
What you see is what you get
This is me, hey you
If you want me, don't forget
You should take me as I am
'Cause I can promise you
Baby, what you see is what you get

I know you watch me when I'm dancin'
When I party with me friends
I can feel your eyes on my back, baby
I can't have no chains around me, baby can't you see
I could be anything you dream of, but I gotta feel free
You should never try to change me
I can be nobody else
And I like the way I am

[Repeat Chorus]

You should never try to change me
I can be nobody else
Believe me, you'll be looking for trouble if you hurt me
I can promise you, you'll be looking for trouble
Believe me, yeah yeah yeah yeah

"Lucky"

This is a story about a girl named Lucky… 

Early morning, she wakes up
Knock, knock, knock on the door
It's time for makeup, perfect smile
It's you they're all waiting for
They go…
"Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say…

[CHORUS:]
She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night

Lost in an image, in a dream
But there's no one there to wake her up
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning
But tell me what happens when it stops?
They go…
"Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say…

[Repeat CHORUS]

"Best actress, and the winner is…Lucky!"
"I'm Roger Johnson for Pop News standing outside the arena waiting for Lucky"
"Oh my god…here she comes!"

Isn't she lucky, this Hollywood girl?
She is so lucky, but why does she cry?
If there's nothing missing in her life
Why do tears come at night?

[repeat chorus twice]

"One Kiss From You"

I'm dreaming of one kiss from you
A love long and true
We'll go on and on and… 

I don't wanna hear that I'm too young
To know it's love that makes me feel this way
'Cause I don't have to feel the heat of the sun
To know it's shining on me every day
When it's warm outside
And the look in your eyes
Is longing to show me the way
I don't want to wait

[CHORUS:]
Just one kiss from you, and suddenly
I see the road laid out in front of me
You give me strength, you give me hope
And when you hold me in your arms
You make me whole
And I don't know just what I would do
Without one kiss from you

I don't wanna hear my time will come
When it feels like it's already here
We should learn to walk before we run
But why go anywhere when you're so near
'Cause when I reach out to you
So sad and confused
And feeling like I could cry
You dry my eyes

[Repeat CHORUS]

I'm dreaming of one kiss from you
A love long and true
We'll go on and on and…
I'm looking for one kiss goodnight
To last all my life
On and on and…

[Repeat CHORUS]

I'm looking for one kiss goodnight
To last all my life

"Where are you Now"

Calling out your name
Your face is everywhere
I'm reaching out to you
To find that you're not there
I wake up every night
To see the state I'm in
It's like an endless fight
I never seem to win 

I can't go on as long as I believe
Can't let go when I keep wondering

[CHORUS:]
Where are you now, what have you found
Where is your heart, when I'm not around
Where are you now, you gotta let me know
Oh baby, so I can let you go

I can hear your voice
The ring of yesterday
It seems so close to me
But yet so far away
I should let it out
To save what's left of me
And close the doors of doubt
Revive my dignity

But, I can't go on as long as I believe
Can't let go when I keep wondering

[Repeat CHORUS]

I should let it out, it's time to let you go
Oh baby, I just want to know

[Repeat CHORUS]

"Can't Make You Love Me"

I'm just a girl with a crush on you 

Don't care about money
It doesn't give me half the thrill
To the thought of you, honey
So tell me that you want me still
If only I could trade the fancy cars
For a chance today, it's incomparable
I might be sitting with the movie stars
Everybody say that I have it all

[CHORUS:]
But I can't make you love me
Is it my life or the things I do?
Can't make you love me
I'm just a girl with a crush on you

I have been through changes, yeah
But I'm still the girl you used to know
It's made me no different
So tell me why you had to go
Oh baby, I will trade the fancy cars
For a chance today, it's incomparable
I might be sitting with the movie stars
Everybody say that I just have it all

[Repeat CHORUS]

Just the thought of being close to you
It's incomparable
Should be happy with the life I live
And the things I do
Seems like I have it all

Can't make you, make you love me baby
It's my life, what can I do?
Can't make you love me, alright
I'm just a girl with a crush on you

[Repeat CHORUS]

I'm just a girl with a crush on you
